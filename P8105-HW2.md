# Problem 1 NYC Transit Data

## Section 1 Data Import

``` r
NYCtransit_df =
    read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", na = c("NA", "", ".", " ")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  unite("routes_served", c(route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11), sep = ",", remove = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE) |> 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, routes_served, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |>  mutate(
    entry = case_match(
      entry,
      "YES" ~ TRUE,
      "NO" ~ FALSE
    )
  ) |> 
  relocate(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, routes_served, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)
```

The NYC Transit Subway Entrance and Exit dataset contains information
about different subway station’s entrances and exits. Other detailed
information, such as which subway lines stop at which station and their
geographic coordinates, ADA compliance, and detailed information about
the entrances, staffing status, etc.In this step, I cleaned the dataset
by only keep the required variables: line, station_name,
station_latitude, station_longitude, routes_served, entry, vending,
entrance_type, ada. The variable “entry” also converted to logical.
After the cleaning step, the tidy dataset contains 1868 rows and 9
columns.
